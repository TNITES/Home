  <main>
    <p>This page is dedicated to the alumni of our school. We are proud of our alumni and their accomplishments.</p>
    <p>Our alumni are leaders in their fields, making a difference in the world. They are also active members of our community, giving back to the school that helped them succeed.</p>

    <h2>PURPOSED VISION OF TAA</h2>
    <p>Alumni who wish to be a member have direct access to the Association through this automated webpage. We are reluctantly working on automatically generating membership cards after paying the minimum required amount of ₹500 through a link and payment gateway. </p>
    <p>It will imbue the mass registration drive of members to work on fundamental principles and aims.</p>
    <p>It will help contribute to TAA's laid objectives, and they will be expected to lend the time & resources for its success & productivity.</p>
    <p>Value the TAA's noble efforts and work for the basic message in which the Association is formed.</p>
    <p>Any alliance is based on real-time access for the inclusion of maximum participants. In this direction, to sustain as an association, our primary focus is towards implementing the plan for the year and a dedicated column, "सम्झना र स्मृति", has been programmed where members can share & write their experiences freely.</p>
